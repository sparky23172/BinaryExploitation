Differences from 32 to 64
# Find RIP offset
stack = core.rsp # 64 bit changes from EIP to RIP. But you can't go directly to RIP, you have to look at RSP

# Looks for the first 4 characters of the rsp to find the offset for RIP
pattern = core.read(stack, 4) # Lets you look at the first 4 characters for RSP to get the offset for RIP

# Everything else is just changes to make the variable names more accurate
